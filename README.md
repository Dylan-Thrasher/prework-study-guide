# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created to provide experience in fundamental building blocks towards starting my journey as a programmer. Additionally, it provided a way to document notes and reference information that I believed I would find helpful to review and have access to remotely. This exercise demonstrated several parts of the process, including some of the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It also provided a way to learn how to debug and actively fix code, along with setting up good practices like committing often.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to reference not only notes, but examples of different building blocks for learning programming. Through including various pieces such as CSS and JavaScript, it demonstrates an example of a basic page and how it can be built to contain information, be structured in a visually aesthetic way, and include interactivity. When using the DevTools console on the page itself, we can see the results of a randomized study suggestion as well.
